Description: This package provides functions for an Interactive
    Differential Expression Analysis of RNA-sequencing datasets, to
    extract quickly and effectively information downstream the step
    of differential expression. A Shiny application encapsulates
    the whole package. This version focuses on immunology applications
    and is developed for the Advanced Immunology course at Institut Pasteur.
